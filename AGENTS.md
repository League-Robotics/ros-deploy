# AGENTS.md — this repo publishes docs to the League Robotics hub

Documentation for this repo lives in the **GitHub wiki**:
<https://github.com/League-Robotics/ros-deploy/wiki>

The League Robotics docs hub *clones the wiki* and publishes it at
<https://league-robotics.github.io/subsystems/ros-deploy/>. The hub never writes back here —
edit wiki pages directly.

## What to do

When you learn something a future agent will need, edit or add a page in the wiki:

- Each wiki `*.md` page is one published page and needs `title:` and `blurb:` front matter.
- `docs/wiki/_subsystem.yml` (the ONLY file here) holds this subsystem's metadata
  (name / title / blurb). Changes to it auto-ping the hub.
- Add an `updated:` date to a page's front matter when you change it.
- After editing wiki pages, manually trigger a rebuild from the hub's Actions tab:
  <https://github.com/League-Robotics/League-Robotics.github.io/actions>

## How to understand what to do

The complete contract — file formats, the notify workflow, how to register — is the
